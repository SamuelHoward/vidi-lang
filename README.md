# vidi-lang
The Vidi Programming Language is a language I designed. This repository contains the code for an interpreter I made for
this language. The interpreter is made in C++. Learn more about the language at the site below:

https://samuelhoward.github.io/vidi-site/

After cloning this repository, you can start running Vidi code after running `make` by using `./vidic <ProgramName.vd>`. Example programs are in the
`Examples` directory. If you make local changes to the language, simply run `make` to rebuild the interpreter. You will of course
need to be able to use gcc and make to be able to do this.
